# Online-Food-Aggregator

In this project, we analyze the data from the online delivery company's pilot cities (City A, City B, and City C) to determine whether implementing the new service is a good idea or not. The company's main income calculation is based on the delivery fee and a percentage commission of the order food price. The decision to implement the new service is based on a thorough analysis of customer behavior and income generated from each city.

For each city, calculate the income generated from both orders using the new service and orders not using the new service. This can be done using the provided income calculation formula:

Income = Delivery Fee + (Order Food Price * Percentage Commission)

The analysis of the pilot city data provides valuable insights into the potential success of implementing the new service. By considering factors such as adoption rate, income, and customer behavior, the company can make an informed decision about expanding the new service to additional cities or improving its features based on the findings.
